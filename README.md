### **Project Description**
Develop a crypto trading bot (python script) that leverages features from at least one ML framework, signals derived from a crypto exchange, and sentiment from a media source. MVP is for Bitcoin only, but will expand asset/feature set if time allows.
<br><br>

### **Objectives / Project Questions to Answer**
* Use machine learning to create a model to predict price movements of bitcoin
* If time allows expand to other crypto coins
* Implement our model into a trading bot
* If time allows, develop a dashboard for displaying useful feature set data.
<br><br>

### **Data Sources (APIs, Datasets)**
* Crypto asset information
    * CCXT Library (e.g. Kraken API)
* Sentiment Text
    * Twitter API
    * Reuters API
    * Reddit API
<br><br>

**Rough Breakdown of Tasks**
* Finding Data & Ingestion
* Data Preparation
* Feature Engineering
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation
* Trade-Strategy Execution
* Predictions and Conclusions
* Stretch Goals include additional crypto assets and data visualization features
